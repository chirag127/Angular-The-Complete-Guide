# Angular - The Complete Guide

This repository contains the code I wrote while taking the Angular - The Complete Guide course on Udemy. The course covers a wide range of topics, including Angular fundamentals, components, directives, pipes, services, HTTP requests, routing, forms, and deployment.

## Table of Contents



## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the application locally, run the following command:

```sh
ng serve
```

Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4200` to see the app running.

Each section and module of the course is organized in its own folder under the `src/app` directory. You can navigate to the corresponding folder to see the code for that section/module.
